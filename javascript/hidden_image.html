    <p>One of the most popular instruments in the modern day is the guitar. Most people have heard music in them whether they notice it or not. One of the greatest things about guitars is how unique each one can be. There are many variations between each that make them sound different than any other. Sure, there are some more popular sounding ones that could sound similar, but each one has adjustable settings and in the end it is all up to the guitarist's preference.</p>

    <h2>Customizable Guitar Parts</h2>
    <p>When customizing the guitarâ€™s sound, the guitar itself is not the only thing that can change its sound. There are other factors like strings and picks that can change the general sound of the guitar. Some strings may sound more jazzy while others give you a heavy metal vibe. The strings also have different thicknesses which can change how it sounds, plays, and feels.</p>
